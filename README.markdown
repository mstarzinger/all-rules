All-Rules Mail Bundle
=====================

This is a bundle acting as a plug-in for Apple's Mail application serving just
one specific purpose. It provides an additional menu item located under
"Message -> Apply All Rules" which applies all active rules to the currently
selected messages while ignoring any present "Stop evaluating rules" action.

This can be useful to model additional rules, which are only evaluated
explicitly when triggered by this bundle, but not automatically on all
received mail.

Compatibility:
--------------

This bundle was tested using the following environment, but might just as well
work with similar versions. Let me know of your findings.

* Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6
* Apple Mail 4.4
* Message Framework 4.4

The same (and more) could be done with Indev's Mail Act-On bundle,
unfortunately that bundle is sold under a commercial license. With my bundle I
cloned the essential feature which was indispensable for my personal use.
